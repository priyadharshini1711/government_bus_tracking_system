## General Information
- The government bus tracking system is a module that helps us to track the required bus to our destination
- This helps to identify the distance of the bus from the depot to the nearest bus terminus of the user.
- This helps to save the users time instead of waiting for a long time in the bus stop.
- The project was part of the mini project expo at VEC in the year 2016 -2020


## Technologies Used

### Software ###
- Arduino C

 ### Hardware ###
- ARDUINO UNO BOARD
- ARDUINO PC INTERFACE USB PORT
- SENSOR(INFRARED OR ULTRASONIC SENSOR)
- RFID READER
- RFID TAGS
- PC(WINDOWS 8 OS)
- CONNECTING WIRES


## Features
- This module helps us to track the buses using GPS inside the bus
- It tells the exact distance of the bus from your location. the location is always your default bus stop selected
- You can switch between default bus stops
- You can select the bus route number that should be tracked
- This app also helps to find the bus route number to your destination
